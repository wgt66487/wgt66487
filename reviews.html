  <h2>Review #1 : 52 Shades of Red v2</h2>
  <p>This is one of my favorite products. Lets get strait into this. First I'm going to talk about the video quality. Shin and his friend Mike walk you through the whole routine in great detail. For the first hour they go through the routine like it's a lecture. In the ~45 minuets after that Shin explanes how to make your gimmicks. In the time remaining he shows you how to preform and make the bonus effects.
